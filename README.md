Task 1: Perform Basic Mathematical Operations
Fristly I started by taking the input of 2 numbers from the user. I made sure to use "int" so the the input is not in the string datatype. Then I used 4 different arithmatic operations (+, -, * and /) to perform the task.
Task 2: Create a Personalized Greeting
Here again I took 2 inputs from the user - 1. the first name and 2. the last name. Then we used string concatenation method to concatenate/join the first name and last name. Lastly, print a greeting message saying "Hello, (full name)! Welcom to Python Program."
